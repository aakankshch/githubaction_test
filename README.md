## This is a python app

We are creating workflows that do unit testing on every pull request to your repository or deploy merged pull requests to production.

This is to understand how GitHub actions work: GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform.
We have a src folder where we write our Python code and a tests folder for unit testing using pytest.
